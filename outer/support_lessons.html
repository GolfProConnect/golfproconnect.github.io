                <p>No, “online” the amateur will need to connect with you to book lessons, any amateur
can connect with you unless you decide to delete them. You should also try and
encourage amateurs to have an account even if they just call into the shop and book
a one off lesson, once they have an account set up they will more likely book future
lessons, especially online.</p>
                <h3>Can I book in a non connected amateur myself?</h3>
                <p>Yes, click “add new client”, enter their information and book them in under their name
as you would any other connected client.</p>
                <h3>Why can an amateur book a lesson in on my schedule without paying in advance?</h3>
                <p>Your PayPal business account has not been set up and linked to your GPC profile yet
through your settings Tab or you have linked them up through settings but have not
clicked the “advanced payment” option in your settings.</p>
                <h3>Why am I getting lessons booked in but not getting paid in advance, even though I
have my PayPal account set up?</h3>
                <p>You have not clicked the “get paid in advance” button in your settings. As a result even
though your PayPal has been activated, it has not been able to link to the schedule
until you click that button in your settings. This button takes amateurs to your PayPal
payment page before a booking is confirmed and appears on your schedule.</p>-->
