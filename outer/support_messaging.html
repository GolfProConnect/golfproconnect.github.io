                <h3>Do I receive text messages with my monthly membership?</h3>
<p>Each Premium GPC member will have their SMS account replenished to 100 credits each month as part of their GPC subscription. These can be used as automatic text alerts for upcoming lessons or just for advertising to clients. Standard account holders will not receive any free monthly SMS but both standard and premium accounts will have the option to purchase SMS bundles via their account.</p>
<p>For ALL users during our current FREE unrestricted access phase, free texts will be unavailable however the purchasing of SMS bundles will be available shortly. When a fully subscribed Premium member your account will be updated with the SMS credits as outlined above.</p>
<h3>How do I top up credits to send sms messages?</h3>
<p>On the top of each page you will see a green box this tells you how many text message credits you have left. To top up go to "my account" and purchase an SMS bundle. You will see your new balance next time the screen refreshes.(this function will not be available until early 2014)</p>
<p>This is a great way to easily market your business as study`s show “95% of people view a text message within 7 seconds of receiving it”.</p>
<h3>How do I send a SMS or email to a specific group or all clients?</h3>

These clients will be displayed in a paginated form (10 clients per page, pages numbered 1,2,3 etc) if you wish to select all clients on this page simply click the "select all" tab on the right and send. Repeat this process throughout the remaining pages.</p>
<p>When sending a to ALL clients simply create your message and when defining recipients "select all" and send. Again repeat this process on each page of clients 1,2,3 - 12, "Select all" is all the clients displayed on that particular page not all clients in your client section.</p>
<p>?Wait a couple of seconds and a successful action notification will appear informing you the message(s) have been sent.</p>
<h3>Where are my GPC messages sent?</h3>

                <!--<h3>Why is my correct email so important?</h3>

up your account successfully. Also for the email function to send clients something, an
incorrect email will not allow this function to work.</p>

amateur’s dashboard and their message section. This is great way to send your clients
upcoming events offers etc and is a great marketing tool, however limit your posts to a
couple a week too many will discourage amateurs from connecting with you.</p>
                <h3>How do I top up credits to send sms messages?</h3>
                <p>On the top of each page you will see a green box this tells you how many text message

                <p>You can buy extra text messages in bundles, each bundle equates to 5p per text
message. This is a great way to easily market your business as study`s show “95% of
people view a text message within 7 seconds of receiving it”.</p>

type of group i.e. Ladies morning clinic and all clients associated with that keyword will
come up, you will then need to select all clients from that group by clicking the select
