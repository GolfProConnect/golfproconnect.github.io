                <h3>How do I offer online video analysis as a chargeable service?</h3>
                <p>To Activate online video analysis create a service entitled - Video Upload - Upper case V AND U, the rest lower case and a space between Video and Upload.</p>
<p>You must name the service as described here. Once Video Upload is entered correctly you can add a description and price as normal.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE 1. Not creating a service entitled Video Upload or attaching a price of 0.00 when creating the service will cause uploading problems for your clients.</p>
<p>This service should be activated and a price attached even if you wish to not charge for this service. Your clients always have the option to not pay the fee during the uploading process and you will still recieve their upload.</p>
<p>You will however be notified via email of pre-paid uploads, so it is important to create the service and attach your desired fee.<img src="content/images/video_add_services.png" alt="Add Video Service"></p>
                <h3 id="video_two">How do I analyze a video and send a back to my client?</h3>
                <p>When receiving a video from a client their name will be clearly displayed and stored to their personal profile in your clients section as well as in your video section.</p> 
<p>You may or may not have been paid in advance for this video, (depending if you have “set up advance pay” and synced your PayPal account to your GPC account). You will be clearly notified via email of a recent upload when advance pay is activated.</p>
                <p><b>Please note:</b> In order for analysis to be extremely quick and easy you are now sharing the received video with your amateur client. So when you are happy with an edit point SAVE it! If you don’t DELETE it and do it again until you do, you have total control over the video now and in the future.</p>
                <p>When you have completed the analysis review the video, keeping in mind your client will see effectively a duplicate of your newly analyzed video. Your clients have no control over the analyzed video they simply view this video via their GPC accounts and interact with you through the message section.</p>
                <h3>Notifying an amateur of a completed analysis!</h3>
                <p>When you have reviewed and are happy with the analysis simply send the client a short GPC message to let them know the analysis is complete and ready for them to view via their amateur account.</p>
                <p>When you message a client via your GPC account they receive a notification email of their new message.</p>
                <h3>Notifying an amateur of a completed Dual analysis!</h3>
                <p>When messaging the client as normal of the completed analysis, simply state that you completed the analysis in “dual mode” not “single mode” so they should look in the appropriate section of their account.</p>
                <h3>My video analysis dashboard, will it have more functions?</h3>
                <p>Yes, Zoom and full screen analysis are two tools we are currently working on for the fixed main account dashboard. The app also will have added tools.</p>
                <h3>How do I record what I’m saying during video analysis?</h3>
                <p>On the video editing tool bar you will see the “record audio” feature. For best results please insure the speakers of the device being used are up to the max, and the volume on the video player is up to max also.<p>
                <p>This is especially important in Dual mode. The audio recording should generally be the last piece of analysis when saving a clip IE. Draw all your analysis lines first and then record the audio to explain those lines.</p>
                <p><b>Please note: In dual mode when recording audio only select the screen you wish to talk about. Do not select both screens in the same saved edit point.</b></p>
                <h3>How do I get paid for a video analysis?</h3>
                <p>When a client uploads a video to you via their GPC account two things can happen. Should you have not yet linked your GPC account with your PayPal account the video will be received by you as normal but no payment will be received.</p>
                <p>Should you have successfully linked your GPC and PayPal accounts, the amateur will be taken to a payment page during the uploading process, they will be prompted to pay the fee you have created for this service in your “services” section.</p>
                <p>You will be notified via email that you have received payment from a client for your video analysis service. It is between you and the client after that, remember this is YOUR personal online business.<img src="content/images/video_payment.png" alt="Video Payment"></p>
                <h3>How does a client upload a video to me?</h3>
                <p>Amateurs send videos from their amateur GPC account to any of their connected pros, via their laptop, tablet or smartphone. Advance payment is available on all platforms PC and mobile devices.</p>
                <h3>Can I upload a video to my account only?</h3>
                <p>Yes of course. Simply select your name only when uploading.</p>
                <p>Uploading videos to your own account is important for using example swing videos during dual analysis and analyzing your own swing.</p>
                <p>Also uploading tuition videos and sharing with clients is an excellent way to stay connected with your client base.</p>
                <h3>What do Private and Public mean, when saving a Dual session?</h3>
                <p>This is a feature that is under development. In the future you will have the ability to upload videos and make them “public”, when public ALL your clients will receive the video immediately (currently you must upload a video to a single client), this can be an analyzed video of a pro or a tuition video for example. This will promote greater client interaction and keep you connected with your client base.</p>
