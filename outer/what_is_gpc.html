              <h1>Is this how you run your business?</h1>
              
              <p>When was the last time you played with hickory shafts? It’s got loads of olde worlde charm, but would you rely on it in competition? No.<p>Stacked against you already are fiendish course design, sand traps, rough, water hazards, wind, rain, distractions...</p>
              <p>If you were offered a legit technological advantage in competition, would you use it? Yes.</p>
              <p>So why are you still running your teaching business with a desk diary; making notes on Post-its, excel client sheets, tatty teaching cards, losing cash from customers not pitching up for lessons; juggling texts and phone calls; not optimizing your teaching time...?</p> 
              <p>Think of the biggest brands in golf... what connects them? Technological innovation. GolfProConnect uses digital technology to connect you to your paying customers like never before.</p>



              <h1>Welcome to the golf-coaching renaissance</h1>
              <p>PGA Pros like us, we’re very good at selling the latest technology to our club members, pupils, proshop customers and so forth - it’s the lifeblood of our business. People rely on us to guide them towards the best in comfort, distance, stability, forgiveness, bounce, spin, grip, control, accuracy, battery life, flex, competitive advantage...</p>

              <h1>So why are we sometimes so slow to get technology working for ourselves?</h1>
              <p>GolfProConnect does not replace any software you might already be using, because it’s unique. Effectively it’s a portable online business system designed by PGA pros for PGA pros, to replace the desk diary, post-it notes, and generally the way that booking lessons has been done since the days of Sam Snead. But it’s so much more...</p>
              <p>Our studies show that the amateur golfer lesson taker would rather send the pro a few swings in between lessons to help their progress than keep on having full lessons example below</p>

              <p>You know about correcting flaws, right?</p>

              <blockquote>“We never lost our teaching business, we re-located it... We used to coach at our academy, now the worldwide web is our academy, and we’re helping fellow PGA pros start their own online businesses.” – Gary Rushgrove, Director GolfProConnect</blockquote> 
              <p>Picture this...The Lesson</p> 
              <p>It’s a fundamental shift to make golf-coaching more profitable for pros by giving improving golfers more choice about how they learn. Technological innovation has impacted most areas of golf but coaching has been left behind until now.</p>
              <p>There’s a basic flaw in how we’ve approached golf teaching. The golfer phones to book a lesson; if he/she bothers to arrive he/she pays for a half hour of your time (let’s call it £20); you watch him/her hit a bucket of balls – correct his/her flaws; and he/she departs. Perhaps two days elapse before he/she gets to the range again... he/she’s forgotten one or two key points you made, and begins practice – grooving a whole new swing fault or something much worse into the muscle memory. So, he/she concludes the lesson hasn’t worked and that’s the last you’ll see of him/her, EVER!!.</p>
              <p>But from now, it’s going to be different, because now there is a solution - GolfProConnect!.</p>
              <p>Let’s rewind the previous scenario</p> 
              <p>The golfer phones to book a lesson or books across the internet via the pro’s online schedule. Before the lesson the student receives an email and text reminder of the lesson time, date etc. He/she arrives on time and ready to start. Immediately after the half hour lesson, the student is buoyant. You’ve isolated problems, shown how to correct them, it’s been seen that it works and the student considers this £20 very well-spent. The lesson ends when you show how to establish a permanent link with your GolfProConnect profile for his ultimate convenience. You send the client the lesson notes to his/her free profile, where he/she can review the lesson at his/her convenience. These notes/videos are stored on the student’s file and act as a teaching database (great for monitoring progress). Just before he/she leaves you might borrow his/her Smartphone to save the shortcut to GPC. Now, the student is connected.</p>  
              <p>For the first time in golfing history, you’re able to establish a two-way digital connection with your students. How professional do you look now? Who`s pro-active, who`s got the respect and integrity of the improving, dedicated......YOU HAVE!</p>
              <p>“If you’re too busy to pick up a golf club for a few days, you might be disappointed. If you practise what we learned today and it works, that’s brilliant, but if it doesn’t you might just have forgotten one or two key points.</p> 
              <p>“If it goes pear-shaped, use your phone, iPad or tablet to shoot a quick video of your swing (balance it on the wall of the driving bay or get a buddy to shoot a few swings). Upload it to me and I’ll tell you what’s going wrong. That’ll take five minutes of my time; not £20’s worth. For the cost of a large bucket of range balls I can literally be looking over your shoulder wherever you are, because now we have a permanent connection and you can use it to book weekly lessons throughout the year or get a five minute fault-fix online.</p>
              <p>Hence “1/4 of the time= 1/4 of the price” concept.</p>
              <p>You’re now a digital PGA Pro. You’re selling to the converted. You’re in profit. You’re in business. You’re in your customers’ digital orbit. You’re GolfProConnected, here endeth the lesson.</p>
