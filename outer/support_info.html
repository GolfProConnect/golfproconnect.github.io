                <h3>How do I get paid for my services?</h3>
                <p>Please refer to the PayPal subsection within this help guide.</p>
                <p>Once this simple process is complete, set up your SERVICES and you are ready to receive payments!</p>
                <h3>What Browser should I use for GolfProConnect?</h3>
                <p>GolfProConnect recommends to use Google Chrome as the main browser as it works best for our software, however all others browsers work well with the exception of older versions of “Internet Explorer”</p> 
<p>We recommend that you should download “Google Chrome” for desktop and mobile devices if you don’t have it already.This browser allows users to get the most from your GPC account.</p>
                <h3>What is the green tick and Red Cross beside appointments on my dashboard?</h3>
                <p>By law GolfProConnect must give the amateurs the option not to prepay for a service if they wish. These red and green notifications indicate to you who have prepaid and who have not, making it easy for the pro to reconcile their PayPal account each week.</p> 
                <p>This method offers you full flexibility as it still allows your clients to book a lesson without advance payment. You always know via your account who has and has not paid!</p>
                <h3>How do I switch off advance pay?</h3>
                <p>Simply go to your SETTINGS page, please leave the box in step 3 blank and click save at the bottom. Advance pay for ALL your services is now deactivated.</p>
                <h3>How do I switch off automatic email reminders?</h3>
                <p>In settings, you have the option for your email reminders to be sent out 24 or 48 hours in advance of the appointment, leaving these boxes blank will switch off any email reminder.</p>
                <h3>How do I switch off automatic text reminders?</h3>
                <p>This is done exactly the same way as above; if you leave the text message reminder box in your settings blank, text message reminders will be disabled.</p>
                <h3>Can customers book in and pay on a mobile device?</h3>
                <p>Yes, clients can book in and pay as normal on mobile devices, as your PayPal account is mobile optimised.</p>
                <h3>How can I change my account settings/password?</h3>
                <p>If you go to the arrow next to your log in name there is a drop down menu, if you click on “My Account” you will be able to change your password</p>
                <h3>Can I receive credit/debit cards as payment?</h3>
                <p>Yes, clients can pay for services in many ways to your PayPal account, and they do not need to have a PayPal account themselves as credit/debit cards are all accepted.</p>
                <h3>How do I set up a PayPal account if i do not have one?</h3>
                <p>Go to your SETTINGS and follow the PayPal link provided.</p>
                <h3>How long does it take to set up my PayPal account?</h3>
                <p>As this account requires no “vetting” around 10 minutes should get you all set up. If this is your first PayPal account, you will need to do some verifying procedures with PayPal these can take up to 24hrs.</p>
                <p>Once you are fully verified simply go to your GPC SETTINGS section and follow the instructions to link your accounts and you are ready to go!</p>
                <h3>Do amateurs need a PayPal account to pay me?</h3>
                <p>No, they will be able to pay with a credit or debit card.</p>
                <h3>How do amateurs pay me for services online?</h3>
                <p>Clients click on a service and book a time,they are then brought to a payment page for specifically for your account, as you have linked your GolfProConnect profile to your PayPal account via API all the info for the particular service is displayed on the payment page and the client simply enters their payment details and once the transaction is complete they are brought back to our site where the booking is confirmed and the money is in YOUR PayPal account.</p>
                <h3 id="redwriting">Why does Red Writing come up in my services page?</h3>
                <p>This is a warning that you have set up advance pay through your SETTINGS section but not yet linked your PayPal account to your GPC account (please look at the PayPal FAQ page).</p>
                
                <!--<h3>What is My Dashboard?</h3>
                <p>The dashboard is the hub of your GolfProConnect site. This is where you will you’re your
upcoming lessons, new videos, new messages and new appointments.</p>
                <h3>How do I get paid?</h3>
                <p>This is what it’s all about! Please look at the “linking my GPC account with my PayPal
account”</p>

                <p>On the top of each page is your login name, if you click on this and choose settings on
the drop down menu, you then need to click on the “get paid on the day” box then click
save on the bottom of the page. It’s very important this box is ticked if you don’t want
to be paid online and would prefer to be paid on the day of the lesson from the online
booking.</p>

you find you are doing a high number of “Online Video Lessons” or being paid online

your limits increased. (This is a good thing)</p>
                <h3>Do amateurs need a PayPal account to pay me?</h3>
                <p>No, they will be able to pay with a credit or debit card</p>

                <h3 id="redwriting">Why does “Red Writing” come up in my services page?</h3>
                <p>This is to show that this service is not connected to your PayPal account. This means 2
possible things, you have clicked “get paid thru PayPal” in your settings tab but have not
linked your GPC account to your PayPal account as of yet or if the red writing is showing
up for your “online video analysis service” you have not entered the words “video
upload” for that service which is needed to set up that service.</p>-->
